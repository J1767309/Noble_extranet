Homewood Suites Salt Lake City Downtown,Aimbridge,5/14/2025,Y,Issue,Behind the set in Occ growth for July ,Hotel at -47.6 vs the CS -33.7 
Homewood Suites Salt Lake City Downtown,Aimbridge,5/14/2025,Y,Issue,SkyWest production is dropping for the month of May and into June.,"SkyWest demand is well below plan. Below is a short brief with source lines from the meeting.

What changed

Actual class size – last two classes checked in at 18 rooms.

“Sky West came in with 18 rooms.”
“…now we’re at 18.”
Contracted versus blocked – contract still shows 70; we had already cut blocks to 35, then 30.

“The contract is 70… then we went down to 35…”
July class cancelled – no replacement volume.

“…they cancelled the July class…”
Shorter winter run – final class departs 3 Dec, not 23 Dec.

“Sky West checks out on December 3rd this year… last year they didn’t check out until December 23rd.”
Why the drop – tighter upfront screening means fewer trainees and no mid-stay failures.

“They’re vetting their candidates clearly much better… when they were coming in at 48… five or eight failed and were sent home.”
Actions already taken

Block washed – June/July block cut to 18 in GRO; matching cut coming in R&I.

“…we’ll go even… we’ll wash it in Grow…”
Future stance – team ready to chop further to 15 if next class stays small.

“I want to aggressively chop them to 15 and wait until they give us our production back.”
Rate integrity – closed government rate on premium suites.

“We have government booking the ginormous double-queen-king rooms at 142. We’ve got to get that turned off.”
Decisions needed

Reset standing block – cap future classes at 20 rooms (drop to 15 if next class again lands at 18).

Re-forecast P&L – remove roughly 2 250 room-nights (≈ USD 350 k at 155 USD ADR).

Renegotiate contract – seek sliding guarantee: pay only for rooms above 20 per night.

Transcript driver: “…we continue to be left holding the bag…”

Replace lost base – open controlled OTA discounts around 4 Jul and 24 Jul (Pioneer Day).

“24th of July is a very large holiday in Utah… lots of parades, rodeos…”
Next steps

Revenue & Sales finalise block wash in both systems by 17 May.

Finance delivers revised forecast by 24 May.

GM/Sales to call SkyWest procurement week of 26 May to discuss volume commitment.

Ops adjusts crew-related staffing from July onward."
