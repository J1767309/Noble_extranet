    'Revenue initiatives by segment: Retail: Will largely remain unchanged, with pricing positioned approximately $10 above most competitors to preserve rate integr ity and value perception. Extended stay will be a key focus for 2026, alongside continued efforts to drive ADR growth. While we''ve se en strong performance in the 30+ night segment, we''ve experienced a decline in 7 -13 night stays. Next year, we aim to regain traction in t hat tier by remaining competitively priced. With the rollout of Independent Product Pricing, we''ll have greater flexibility -removing the hie rarchy between rate levels. This will allow us to better tailor pricing for the 7 -13 night segment and make it more attractive to guest s. Negotiated: Focus on businesses located near our hotel, building strong relationships with the local Chamber and venues. Go b eyond just a nightly rate discount. Offer desirable inclusions like complimentary breakfast, Wi -Fi, parking, late check -out, room upgrades. Use Delph to track interactions with clients to manage the RFP process efficiently. This ensures you never miss a lead, and all communi cation is personalized and timely. Group: Securing a solid Group base to outperform the competition. Respond to Requests for Proposals (RFPs) quickly and with clear, personalized proposals. We will evaluate each opportunity to assess how it could contribute to filling the hotel and increasi ng transient ADR. Encourage bookings during low -demand periods (e.g., midweek or off -season) by offering perks like complimentary meeting spa ce, discounted F&B, or free room upgrades. Acknowledge the need for flexibility in contracts and cancellation policies, as this i s a key factor for event planners. Govt: While market occupancy in this segment remains relatively low, both the comp set and the broader market are trending ju st above 2% year -to-date -whereas we''re currently closer to 1%. This allows an opportunity for strategic focus to regain share. To improve our position in this segment, we plan to ease some of the restrictions that were previously in place throughout mo re of the year -specifically, closing out weekends and applying minimum length of stay requirements on weekdays. This change will help us s tay competitive and more effectively attract bookings Other Discount: Shifting toward growing occupancy through brand -led offers, as group business starts to come back. This year, we leaned a bit more on OTA package promotions, which saw strong year over year growth in occupancy, but didn''t support ADR growth as s trongly. Advance Purchase (AP) rates held up well in terms of ADR, but we''ve been slightly below fair share and have seen a drop in oc cupancy year -over -year.',
